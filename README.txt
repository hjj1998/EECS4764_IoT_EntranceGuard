What is it
Our team focusing on developing a door access control system with mask recognition, temperature monitoring and hand sanitizing models. 

How it works
When a visitor attempts approaching a door installed with Safeguard on Duty module, our system will automatically check whether the person is properly wearing a mask and his body temperature. Only if the person is wearing a mask and the body temperature is normal could have access to this door. Besides, the person also has to finish hand sanitization to gain access. With all safety check passed, the door will open and allow for entrance.

Why we need it
Given that the more contagious variant is spreading across the United States and there is someone who has a weakened immune system, is not yet vaccinated, or is at increased risk for severe disease, continuing to wear a mask indoors anytime you’re around people is very important. This is regardless of vaccination status or the level of transmission in one area. Besides, health experts are encouraging all people to wear a mask indoors in public if they are in an area of “substantial or high transmission”. Wearing a mask in places with higher potential transmission will protect people against the Delta variant and prevent them from possibly spreading it to others. Thus, our system will enforce indoor mask-wearing and help to suppress the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
